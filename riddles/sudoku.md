# Missing Numbers

Someone must have had a bad day, for several of the floor panels have been destroyed. Your eyes are drawn to a console on a wall next to
one of the doors where a notepad has been left behind by someone. It reads:

> Dear Eng. McTornister, Ensign Guybrush forgot the passphrase again and decided that this would be a great time - as you can see - to
> redecorate the interior. I have received noise complaints which I could ignore. What I cannot ignore, however, is the destruction in the
> room. As inspections will be upon us sooner than later, I must insist that you unlock your room, even if - and I quote - 'the bloody
> Ensign always steals all my stuff and tries to build new stuff out of it which only ever works for him, and I am left with broken leftovers.'.
> It was hard enough to ensure that we get this strawberry flavored torque grease, so please - unlock your lab door.

Some lines after this, another message has been written down. The text is less ornamental and written as if in a hurry.

> Addendum: Dear Eng. McTornister, I haven't seen you since the Mate vending machine ran out of Mate. The situation with your door hasn't
> been fixed yet. I must insist that you unlock your door. I cannot for the life of me figure out the passcode you used, and that thing on
> your voicemail about 'logic in the numbers' doesn't help - some are missing, thanks to Ensign Guybrush. Fix this!
