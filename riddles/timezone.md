# Scheduled

The time-based doorlock to Eng. McTornisters' bureau is shut completely. A terminal has been opened, showing the following line

> `[mct@iotornie <2022-10-21 20:00>] > date -s`

Above the terminal are two clocks. The right one seems fixed, its clock hands don't move at all. Both doors are linked to a door on the left.
This particular door system is notorious for using the equality operator
between a reference clock and a real-time clock instead of checking if the time is in range.

To proceed, set the system time so that the doorlock is released. Finish the command shown above after `13:`.
